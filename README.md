# Binary_Classification_Problems

### Binary Classification [roblems prediction project on multiple machine learning models and their evaluation

This project aims to provide an educational experience in the field of machine learning and program classification.

## Project Execution Steps:

### 1. Introduction
In this project, we utilize the Titanic dataset obtained from Kaggle sources.
The ultimate objective of the project is to train multiple models and evaluate their performance.

### 2. Data Analysis
To begin, a thorough examination of the data is conducted, followed by exploratory analysis.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
Identifying and managing Missing Values(Nan) within the dataset is our initial task.
We adopt various techniques to handle features like "Age", "Cabin", and "Embarked".

### 4. Feature Transformation
We convert crucial features such as "Sex", "Embarked", and "Pclass" into numerical data.
The conversion of categorical data to numerical values is executed using approaches like Dummy Variables.

### 5. Model Creation and Training
We employ diverse models, including "Logistic Regression", "Na√Øve Bayes", and "SVM", for predictive analysis.
The dataset is partitioned into training and testing subsets.
Subsequently, the models are trained using the designated training data.

### 6. Model Evaluation
The performance of each model is assessed through various metrics, with Accuracy being a primary focus.
Based on their performance, we select the most optimal model for our classification task.
